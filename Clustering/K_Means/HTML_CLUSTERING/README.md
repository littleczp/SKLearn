> by Lloydâ€™s algorithm & Mini Batch K-Means

step|what|how
---|---|---
1|chooses the initial centroids, choose k|(1)**random choice** with Cross-Validation(unrealized)<br>(2)k-means + + 
2|Turn k templates to feature vectors|(1)Each vector entry is the count of a given tag and class attribute<br>(2)The dimension of the vectors will change as new pages with new tags or class attributes arrive.
3|assign the remaining templates to its nearest centroid|calculate each template Euclidean distances
4|The difference between the old and the new centroids are computed and the algorithm repeats these last two steps until this value is less than a threshold
