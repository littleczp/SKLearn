step|what|how
---|---|---
1|Chooses the initial centroids, choose k|(1)**Random choice** with Cross-Validation(unrealized)<br>(2)K-Means++ 
2|Turn k templates to feature vectors|(1)Each vector entry is the count of a given tag and class attribute<br>(2)The dimension of the vectors will change as new pages with new tags or class attributes arrive.
3|Assign the remaining templates to its nearest centroid|Calculate each template Euclidean distances
4|Repeats until the centroids do not move significantly|The difference between the old and the new centroids are computed and the algorithm repeats these last two steps until this value is less than a threshold

#### feature vectors
```html
<html>
    <body>
        <table class="table1">
            <tr>A</tr>
	        <tr>B</tr>
        <table/>
        <table class="table2">
            <tr>M</tr>
	        <tr>N</tr>
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
```
| tag, class     | position | count |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| html           | 0        | 1     |
| body           | 1        | 1     |
| table, table1  | 2        | 1     |
| tr             | 3        | 4     |
| table, table2  | 4        | 1     |

> Each non-closing (tag, class) pair is mapped to a vector position<br>and the number of times it appears in the document is the value of the vector at that position

When a new page arrives it can be possible that new (tag, class) pairs appear.
For example imagine that this new page arrives:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <a>Another page</img>
    </body>
</html>
```
The new page would be mapped according to this table:

| tag, class     | position | count |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| html           | 0        | 1     |
| body           | 1        | 1     |
| table, table1  | 2        | 1     |
| tr             | 3        | 4     |
| table, table2  | 4        | 1     |
| **a**          | 5        | 1     |
